# Chefspert - Chef's Portal

## Purpose of the app:
This app is designed to allow people who cook to participate in the gig economy and become a business owning Chef via their own customizable store/marketplace to sell and promote their meals to customers. 


## Features and how to use the app:
Chefs will create their own store by choosing a store name of their choice and the page will redirect the Chef to create a login via Facebook or Github. Once logged in, a sample menu can be loaded to provide a visual representation of what the customer will see. The Chef can then manually add data to create the customizable dish. 

A cart lets the Chef see what the user does at checkout as this allows the Chef to ultimately help determine if their dishes are properly priced and suited towards their liking. 

## Tech:
This app is built with React.js
